### Popular AI Model Hacking Blog Posts Shared on X

Based on recent and historical shares on X (formerly Twitter), here are some of the most frequently discussed and "world-class" blog posts on hacking large language models (LLMs), adversarial attacks, jailbreaks, and related vulnerabilities in frontier AI systems. These are drawn from high-engagement posts by security researchers, AI experts, and organizations like OpenAI and NIST. I've focused on technical writeups that are substantive, influential, and commonly reposted for their depth and real-world applicability. They're listed chronologically by publication date (where available), with key highlights and the X post that popularized them.
